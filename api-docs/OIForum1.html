<p><span class="bodycopysub">FlexEthernet</span><br>
This project will address modern transport applications. It will support widely varying payload bandwidth per wavelength due to modulation format optimization. It will extend OIF MLG specifications to be PMD independent, and will provide efficient lane bonding for standard and
non-standard rates.  For more information, contact Dave Stauffer, Physical and Link Layer Working Group Chair at david@kandou.com</p>

<p><span class="bodycopysub">Common Electrical Interface - 56G-Ultra Short Reach</span><br>
This project will develop and produce an implementation agreement for a low power, Ultra Short Reach (<= 1cm) electrical, chip-to-chip interface operating @ 39-56Gbps signalling for MCM use cases (within a single package) and will facilitate optical engine integration within ASIC packaging.  For more information, contact Dave Stauffer, Physical and Link Layer Working Group Chair at david@kandou.com</p>

<p><span class="bodycopysub">Common Electrical Interface - 56G-Extra Short Reach</span><br>
This project will develop and produce an implementation agreement for a low power, Extra Short Reach (<= 50mm) electrical, chip-to-chip interface operating @ 39-56Gbps signalling for PCB use cases and will facilitate an efficient interface to a board mounted optical engine.  For more information, contact Dave Stauffer, Physical and Link Layer Working Group Chair at david@kandou.com</p>



<p><span class="bodycopysub">Common Electrical Interface - 56G-VSR (CEI-56G-VSR)</span><br>
The proposed project will develop a single
Implementation Agreement with one or more electrical specifications for operation across a
single lane for data rates from 39 to 56 Gb/s. The project will determine the optimum modulation
format(s) based on measurements, verification, and CMOS Switch ASIC I/O capability.  For more information, contact Dave Stauffer, Physical and Link Layer Working Group Chair at david@kandou.com</p>

<p><span class="bodycopysub">Common Electrical Interface - 28G-VSR (CEI-28G-VSR)</span><br>
This clause details the requirements for the CEI-28G-VSR very short reach high speed chip-module electrical I/O of nominal baud rates of 19.60 Gsym/s to 28.05 Gsym/s. A compliant device must meet all of the requirements listed below. The electrical I/O is based on high speed, low voltage logic, and connections are point-to-point balanced differential pairs.<br>
The electrical IA is based on channel loss and jitter budgets. It defines the characteristics required to communicate between CEI-28G-VSR drivers and CEI-28G-VSR receivers using copper signal traces on a printed circuit board, a mated connector pair and copper signal traces inside an optical module. These characteristics are normative for the devices and informative for the channel. A ‘length’ is effectively defined in terms of its attenuation and phase response rather than its physical length.  CEI-28G-VSR devices from different manufacturers shall be interoperable.  For more information, contact Dave Stauffer, Physical and Link Layer Working Group Chair at david@kandou.com</p>

                     between clients and the transport network, the connectivity

"...The second IA the OIF membership has approved is an update to the UNI
1.0 Signaling IA, addressing extensions to RSVP-TE signaling protocols. While
not changing UNI 1.0 functionality, the new agreement reflects recent
developments in other standards bodies and builds upon lessons learned from
the OIF’s multi-vendor interoperability event conducted at the OFC 2003 show in
Atlanta.
The UNI 1.0 Signaling Release 2 IA defines a set of services, signaling
protocols and mechanisms used to transport signaling messages and the autodiscovery
procedures that aid signaling. The agreement is aimed at assisting
client and transport network equipment vendors in supporting UNI 1.0 and
defines UNI signaling based on adapting GMPLS RSVP-TE specifications

                     &#8220;&#8230;Improvements made to UNI 2.0 were gleaned from the OIF’s Worldwide Interoperability Demonstration - On-Demand Ethernet Services held last summer between 7 carriers and 8 equipment vendors. UNI 2.0 complies with the ITU-T ASON architecture, and supports all UNI 1.0 signaling with additional protocol extensions for the following new UNI 2.0 features:
-	Support for Ethernet clients, providing both Ethernet Private Line (EPL) and Ethernet Virtual Private Line (EVPL) services
-	Dynamic bandwidth modification, without service disruption
-	G.709 connection services for ODU and OTU switching layers
-	Low order SONET/SDH connection services

For network users, these improvements deliver more responsive and flexible services plus right-sized bandwidth for their dynamic traffic needs. Carriers can simplify their networks, maintain reliability, and improve network performance and customer satisfaction.
	“UNI 2.0 is at the forefront of the emerging Carrier Ethernet market,” said Stephen Shew with Nortel Networks and OIF board member. “It allows Ethernet attached clients to request and modify EPL, and EVPL services that are defined in MEF (Metro Ethernet Forum) specifications.”	
	During the development of the OIF UNI 2.0, two interoperability events were held that refined various UNI 2.0 features, including EPL and bandwidth modification. These service requests were signaled from client Ethernet equipment or application and adapted into SONET/SDH at the edge nodes, enabling transport services with global coverage.
	“The OIF continues to test the interoperability of UNI with close collaboration between equipment vendors and carriers,” said Jim Jones of Alcatel-Lucent and OIF’s vice president of marketing.  “OIF members then incorporate the results of those tests into the IA, providing the industry with ready-to-use, mature specifications.”

                     over ribbon fiber and reaches up to 300 meters. The 12 lasers
                     can be implemented with a single Vertical Cavity Surface

                        - Very Short Reach Interface Level 5 (VSR-5): SONET/SDH
                        OC-768 Interface for Very Short Reach (VSR) Applications.</a>

                     &#8220;As the first 40 Gbps optical interface project defined
                     by the Forum, VSR5 is four times faster than previous 10
                     Gbps interfaces and is a lower cost alternative to interconnect
                     within a central office (CO). VSR5 is capable of nominal
                     40 Gbps aggregate bit rate intra-office systems for link
                     distances up to 2 km. The IA specifies a set of functional
                     SONET/SDH OC-768/STM-256 interfaces for VSR applications.
                     The complete solution set is intended to address the set
                     of reference applications, while minimizing overall network
                     and operational cost and complexity.&#8221; (From November
